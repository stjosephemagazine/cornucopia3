                My dear Parents, Teachers and Students,<br>
                I was always attracted to the thought – Home is the first school and School is the second home. In fact, today it has come true. Corona virus has altered our life including our school system, teachers, children and parents. Schooling is our first contact with the world, a period of joy, healthy competition, fearing, adjustment, sharing and love.  Our homes have become schools and parents have become teachers too. Unimaginable! But it’s a fact we have to live with now and invariably it is happening- whether we are rich or poor, far or near.<br><br>
                It is not the wide open spaces, classrooms, the library, laboratories or the large fields that make the school. It is in the heart of the students and staff that the true institution exists.  E-learning has emerged as the best way of imparting education. Right now, we see ourselves, collectively facing this pandemic, a situation for which we had no experience and little preparation.<br><br>
                At this time, when the whole world is battling against it, St Joseph’s Convent Higher Secondary School has added another feather to its cap; the E-magazine, to provide our students a stage to bring out their creative thoughts and expression. It gives me great joy to meet you all through this E-magazine-a great way to communicate and be creative. Enjoy our magazine as we move on with our lives. I thank all who contributed to this endeavor.<br><br>
                Michael Jordan said “Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships”. This magazine, indeed, is an honest effort to showcase not just the talents of our budding authors, poets and artists, but also to give them a platform to launch themselves and touch the sky. The outstanding articles, poems and artwork of our gifted and innovative minds are sure to captivate the imagination of the readers. With complete faith in their hard work, we are sure that their original ideas will certainly excite and elate your thoughts.<br><br>
                According to academic analysts, the youth of today are more prone to violence and deviant behavior. This deteriorating trend is a matter of great concern to parents as well as teachers. We are all aware through media reports of incidents of abuse, self-inflicted violence, violent outburst, depression, violence using social media and other on-line forms.<br><br>
                Learning is not a process limited to schools and colleges only, nor does it end with the conclusion of one's school career. It is indeed a lifelong process. 0ur School is oriented to the total formation of a child and to adaptations of various methods suiting the dynamics of changing world in order to achieve common goals and objectives. It is further characterized by shared vision - responsibility and above all, love and faith in God in order to achieve these goals. Dear students, it is my message to you all that the people of fine character live by their values. They are honest and are committed to truthfulness in thought, word and deed. True character thus encompasses the capacity for self-discipline. Character creates self-respect, which in turn leads to high self-esteem.<br><br>
                Maturity is reflected in all aspects of character - the decisions we make, the friends we choose and the responsibilities we accept. Always remember to uphold the dignity of people. Be always ready to give preference to other. What you are is god's gift to you. What you become is your gift to God. Have something to live for. Bring out the best in you. Cooperate with your teachers and school authorities. We wish only your wellbeing “With warm wishes and God's blessings".<br><br></p><br clear="left"><p style="font-size: x-large; font-weight: 900;">PRINCIPAL</p></div></section><section id="3"><div class="box"><h2>THE EDITORIAL REPORT</h2><br><hr color="#ffffff"><br clear="left"><p style="font-size: larger;">

            Once there was an old king named Aldorado. He ruled over a large part of Asia and all his rival kings greatly feared him. He was a kind, generous, powerful and compassionate ruler who ruled for the welfare of his subjects. He was a very religious man and donated large amount of money, clothes and garlands to the temples. The king had three sons who were equally skilled in all fields. The thought that was worrying him was the rising power of King Rayuka. He was often called as the “Dark Lord” by other kings as he was the ruler who had never suffered defeat in any battle. He mercilessly used his sword against his enemies and knew defeating Aldorado was not an easy task. Rayuka’s army was huge and was headed by a number of well-trained Generals. In due course of time Rayuka conquered all the neighbouring kingdoms of Aldorado. Suddenly one day, Rayuka waged a war against Aldorado. It was going difficult for Aldorado, each and every day he lost thousands of soldiers and this drained the Royal Treasury. In a time of three days Rayuka took the two of the largest states Leotaet and Fardinabad under his control.<br clear="left"><br>
            Aldorado,  then  realising  the  crisis,  called  his  Ministers,  Officials,  Generals, Advisors  and  his  sons  in  the  Royal  Court.  Aldorado  said,  “If  we  do  not  do something  quick  then  soon,  we  will  suffer  death  in  the  hands  of  Rayuka.  We should think of a smart and effective plan.” After some time Prince Sagitario, his eldest son asked his father, “Father, I wonder, how can a person be so powerful and so undefeatable? I think Rayuka has a secret weapon using which he defeats his enemies.” Then one of the Advisors said to the king, “Your Majesty, if the prince thinks that way, then I advise we should send a spy to reveal the truth.” Aldorado ordered some spies to find out the truth. But he saw no sign of their return.  He  again  sent  other  spies  but  this  time  also  they  did  not  return.  He became worried about this. Just then a soldier entered the court and said to the king, “Your Majesty, early this morning in the midst of the battle I heard a faint scream. Along with me there were some soldiers who heard the scream, they told me that it is the voice of one of the spies sent by your Majesty.” The soldier bowed  and  left  the  Royal  Court.  Then  Prince  and  Commander  Capri  said  to Aldorado, “Father, I also have noticed that King Rayuka only targets the powerful army of guerrilla warriors and Generals even if he has got a chance to capture any state, he still targets them.” “Father, so it is clear that Rayuka has no interest in  conquering  the  lands,  so  what  does  he  want  from  us?  Why  does  he  keep fighting with powerful forces?” asked Mighty Prince Subhasa to his father. “I will take the risk and search for any clues to reveal the secret” said brave Prince Sagitario. Then Subhasa said, “No brother I won’t let you go alone in such crisis, I will come with you since I am stronger than you I can help you.” But Commander Capri said, “None of you two know where the the places are situated, also there are some secret tunnels and underground holes unknown to everyone except me. I will guide you way to search each and every place.” King Aldorado thought about this plan for some time then he said at last, “Yes maybe this plan is perfect but be careful my sons.” “Don’t worry father, we will find out the truth and come back after defeating Rayuka.” said three of them. <br clear="left"><br>
            At midnight, the three princes crept out of the battleground and made their way towards  Pegas.  Pegas  was  situated  in  between  Fardinabad  and  Leotaet.  When they  reached  the  outskirts  of  Fardinabad,  many  guards  were  guarding  the entrance. The guards stopped them and one of them asked them purpose their visit. Then Sagitario told them that they were pilgrims from Fardinabad and they had gone to Mecca for some months and were returning today. The guards let them in and they continued their journey. After 7-8 hours they reached Pegas. Just  then  they  saw  a  group  of  soldiers  charging  towards  them.  The  princes thought that maybe the soldiers identified them. So Subhasa took out his club and started to kill them one by one. Just in a matter of seconds Subhasa killed all the soldiers. His brothers praised his strength and then Capri led them to some secret passages which helped them search each and every place quickly. Soon they  discovered  that  Rayuka  lived  in  a  grand  Palace  which  was  guarded  by soldiers on all sides. Sagitario said, “Oh no! Now it will be difficult to enter the Palace without fighting the soldiers. Also we are only three how can we fight an army of soldiers?” But Capri said to his brother, “Don’t worry. I know a secret hole through which we can enter the Palace.” So he led them to the hole and soon they reached inside the Palace. “We need to be very careful now.” said Capri. They saw some clothes of soldiers lying in the floor. They wore them in order to blend with the soldiers. They made their way out of the room and saw many soldiers and servants, but none suspected them. <br clear="left"><br>
            Soon they came across a room where they could hear loud screams. When they went inside the room, they saw Rayuka was holding a man with his hands. To their surprise the man was becoming older and older while Rayuka was laughing. Soon the man fell down in the floor, dead. Suddenly the green gem in Rayuka’s crown started to glow brighter. He said to himself, “Now I have more power than before, now no one can defeat me with my incredible power!”. The brothers were horrified on what they saw now. None could understand how it could happen. But Sagitario told them that maybe the glowing gem in his crown is the secret weapon which enables him to absorb other’s power and ultimately kills them. “So we need to destroy the gem, else he will absorb our power also.” explained Sagitario. So they came out of their hiding place and Capri taking out his swords, called out to Rayuka, “Rayuka we are the sons of King Aldorado. We have come here to take revenge and take back what belongs to us.” Rayuka turned back and looked at them. He said, “How did you rats enter my Palace? But nevermind, I will absorb your powers and then I will teach you a lesson that weaker people should never interfere  in  powerful  people’s  work.”  Capri  told  his  brothers  to  attack  from different sides and use full force. Rayuka took out his club and started to attackthem.  Sagitario  climbed  up  a  large  box  and  from  there  he  started  to  shower arrows on Rayuka while Subhasa using his club and Capri using his swords fought him on the ground. Rayuka was a skilled warrior, he fought three of them very efficiently. Suddenly he struck a heavy blow to Capri and he fell down. Rayuka was going to absorb Capri’s power when one of Sagitario’s arrow pierced his hand. Taking advantage of the situation, Subhasa struck the gem in the crown, breaking it. Capri again stood up and grabbing one of his swords he cried, “Now we will take our revenge!” then piercing it in Rayuka’s chest he killed him. Thereafter the princes  returned  back  to  their  kingdom  while  without  the  king  the  armies  of Rayuka fled. Aldorado regained all his lost territories. Everyone was thankful to the three brothers and they lived peacefully forever.<br clear="left"><br><br><hr color="#ffffff"><br clear="left">

            In this universe, there is our planet Earth. In our planet there are many people who are always doing some work. Children are playing whereas adults go to work. There are also such people who study space. They are known as space scientists. Mr. Bignut Destin, the boss of some of the people, entered with his son and his best  friend's  daughter,  Clara  Gentillesse.  Because  she  was  interested  in  space studies.  They  were  all  just  introducing  themselves  and  chatting  away  happy, when  suddenly  one  of  the  scientists  looking  through a  telescope shouted “A PLANET! A PLANET WITH LIFE!” “WHAT!” Cried Mr.Destin and pushed him aside and  looked  into  the  telescope.  Clara  was  beyond  speechless.  What  if  it  was actually  a  planet  that  supports  life?  It  would  be  a  great  discovery.  But  then Mr.Destin said “Are you stupid? It was just a shooting star!” And the trio went home after that.<br>
            But in the planet, the one that was about to be exposed, was in chaos. The planet there was different  than ours. The plants and trees are crooked and blue. The water was also blue, as if the planets favourite colour was blue! Their ears were pointed like antennas and they were green in colour. The  weirdest thing about that place was the people inhaled nitrogen and exhaled oxygen! And of course, the trees gave out nitrogen. And because of these weird trees and the way the life survived. There was no ozone layer. So they actually created an ozone layer and managed like that. By mistake the ozone layer was deactivated and  there were changes in just one second. The thing is that, the ozone layer makes the planet invisible and that was all the chaos. In all of these people, there are these two sisters, Natasha Nuevo and Samantha Nuevo. Natasha was a space scientist and worked in a space research centre, NISA. Meanwhile Samantha had her own lab,  Jellylabs,  where  she  made  the  craziest  experiments  which  the  authorities unproved of. So, she and her sister mostly used these inventions in secrecy. One day, after a tiring day, Natasha went to Jellylabs, to her sister’s lab. It was all dark there. So Natasha thought Samantha had went home and turned to retreat but then suddenly the lights switched on and Samantha shouted “SURPRISE!” Natasha turned around smiling to see a very happy Samantha pointing towards something that was covered in a huge plastic sheet. “What is it?” Asked Natasha curiously. “Dear Natasha, it is a TELEPORTING DEVICE!” Said Samantha and pulled the sheet off which revealed a two seated sofa type of thing. Samantha gestured Natasha to sit on the machine. So, both of the girls sat on it and while Samantha was tapping on the buttons to activate it, Natasha thought that this could be one of the greatest achievements of their world, and they could also be friends with the new beings. While Natasha was deep in thought, Samantha had a problem and in lack of patience, she clicked on some button and there was red light  glowing  everywhere  and  shouts  of  ‘ERROR’  everywhere.  Samantha unbuckled  herself  from  the  seat  and  tried  to  make  it  normal.  “WHAT’S HAPPENING?  SAM!” Just when Natasha said ‘sam’ Samantha said “NO!” And Natasha vanished.<br clear="left"><br>
            Natasha suddenly felt an urge to shut close her eyes. So, she did and the next moment when she woke up, she was sleeping on the ground, on something green. She stood upend looked down to see grass. Then when she looked around, she was speechless! All the trees, the water, the air she was breathing and even the dogs chasing the squirrels made her feel so astonished that she started to run around the park. Then she saw some humans and hid behind a nearby bush. The humans were very beautiful they were all different coloured and... they were just incredible foe Natasha. So, she thought that they would help her, be friends with her and work with her. So, she moved forward towards the people. At first all of them  just  stared  at  her  but  then  someone  said  “nice  costume  girl!”  “But  it seriously looks disgusting!” Said another “I wonder which stupid place she is from!” That’s when Natasha got angry and tried to hit them and they all started to shout and calling someone through some black boxes type of thing. Just then some men came wearing the same outfit running towards Natasha which scared her a lot and she began to run away but then something hit her in the head and she fainted.<br clear="left"><br>
            The  next  time she woke up she realised that instead of the ‘green and happy’ looking park, she was in a dark and slightly damp room. When she tried to move, she  realised  that  she  was  chained.  Without  warning,  she  burst  into  tears.  She thought that she would have come here with Samantha but instead, came alone. Then she thought that she could ask for help and be friends with the people here but to no await all these people were cruel and had no pity at all. Just then there was a sound coming from the other side of the door “No! You are being stupid!” Said a boy’s voice “No I am not being stupid! I just want to see it! I was at the park too! I saw it and it was not that dangerous!” “Fine! If you die after seeing it, remember what I said!” Said the boy “yeah! Let’s see!” Said the girl’s voice. There  was  a  little  closed  window  on  the  door  which  opened  and  Natasha  said “What do you want?” The same girl’s voice said “do you speak English?” “Yes, we understand  and  speak  all  languages  because  of  our  antenna  like  ears”  said Natasha  and  the  girl  exclaimed  “wow!  That’s  something  that  nobody  has! Anyway, what is your name?” “My name is Natasha Nuevo what about you?” “My name is Clara, Clara Gentillesse” and then Natasha and Clara talked a lot about each other's worlds “Wow! Hmmm...... Should I tell Mr.Destin? I am sure he will help when I tell him about you” said Clara but Natasha said “No! He is too bad! Don’t tell him!” “He is a bad person? Well, that’s the little truth but he always listens to what I say so I am going to tell him. Bye” said Clara and ran down the corridor “Wait! Come back! Please! Oh no!” Natasha screamed and sat down silently.<br clear="left"><br>
            After an hour or so, the door’s lock was jingling “Please! Don’t do anything to me! I am sorry!” Natasha cried “I had no intention of hurting you and besides, I should be the one who is sorry because Mr.Destin is a bad person! He is not ready to listen to anything no matter what and now he is arranging to take you to a lab in Siberia and isolate you there for ever! But thank God! I found your keys lying on his table and snatched it and ran away!” Explains Clara as she opened the door and was now opening the chains that were locking Natasha “there! Now we can escape let’s go!” Said Clara and took hold of Natasha’s hand and they both ran away.<br clear="left"><br>
            Right when both of them escaped the building, all of the alarms went off and the sirens started to sound. “THEY ARE AFTER US!” And then Natasha bumped into a guy who was riding a scooter and he freaked out and ran away leaving the scooter behind. Without knowing what she was doing she pushed Clara onto the scooter and sat behind her “what are you doing?” Said Clara surprised “what do you mean by? Let’s go!” Said Natasha “but I am just sixteen I don’t have a licence either!” Replied Clara “IS LIFE IMPORTANT OR LICENCE JUST GO!” Screamed Natasha and both of them were off with a scooter and were also on run. <br clear="left"><br>
            Suddenly Natasha said “Clara can we go to a lab? Any lab I know one potion that we could make from which we could send a message to her” “‘her’ meaning who?” Asked Clara “my sister, Samantha and who!” said Natasha and Clara replied “Ok fine then let’s go!” Now they were of to a lab. When they reached one first Clara entered and said “hello there! I have a dangerous monster with me, so you all better get out!” And she pointed towards Natasha who was acting like a dead lion and that convinced all the people and they all ran for their life. “Nice acting!” Said Clara  half-laughing  when  the  last  of  the  scientist  ran  away.  “Thanks!”  Said Natasha “now we should get to work” and saying this she started to mix up the most poisonous and most dangerous looking chemicals. “Is it ok to mix all that stuff?” Asked Clara covering her mouth and backing away when it started to bubble. “You’ll see” said Natasha and dropped the potion on the floor and it turned into a ball when it touched the ball and was not emitting toxic fumes. But then it started to grow and grow util it was big enough to carry two people “at first I thought to send a message but then I thought why don’t I go there myself instead of  a  message,  "said  Natasha.  There  was  some  silence  for  about  a  minute  and Clara said “we will never see each other again!” And both of the girls burst into tears and hugged each other. Then Clara kneeled and said “pease take me with you” “but how can I do that! This is your world you are supposed to live here!” Said Natasha tears still streaming down her face “PLEASE!” Screamed Clara now begging Natasha “but, what about your family if you come with me?” Asked Natasha to which Clara replied “I was the only child of my parents and the died last year. Ever since then Mr.Destin has been taking care of me but I don’t want him to be my parent! He is so cruel! Please take me with you, please” this time Natasha smiled and said “Clara, a new life awaits you in my world” and she beckoned Clara into the ball. Both of them sat in the ball and it broke the roof and flew into the space, to a corner of a universe.<br clear="left"><br><br><hr color="#ffffff"><br clear="left">

            A rainy day in summer makes the weather pleasant. One day it was terribly hot. The scorching sun did not allow people to get out of their houses. All of a sudden cloud  appeared.  Soon,  the  whole  Sky  was  overcast.  It  became  dark.  Lightning and thunder started. With no time it started drizzling. Soon it began to rain. The dream started overflowing. The streets turned into small streams. The children begin to take bath in the rain. Some of them floated paper boats. Some of them splashed water on one another. After the rain stop ground became slippery. Some of  the  people  actually  slipped.  It  made  the  bystanders  laugh.  In  spite  of  all inconvenience the people heaved a sigh of relief. <br><br><hr color="#ffffff"><br clear="left">

            Often heard, people saying "glow like a diamond"..."You are a diamond in your attributes"....mhmm..quite interesting. <br clear="left"><br>
            Does a diamond have its own light?? A diamond is something which traps light within it and tries to portray its fancifulness, alluring people with its  sparkles... without light, it's as inferior as one wrongly considers a mere piece of coal...But We humans...We have our own light...invisible but a matter of flamboyance...We don't need to capture light but discover it, somewhere inside ourselves, trickling with our bloods, pressed between our muscles, dusked by our problems. hidden inside our minds embedded in our grey matters. We just need to extract it out and rear it with our passions, sow the seeds for it and bless the saplings as they rise...God  delivers  the  light  inside  us  but  need  to  nourish  it.  light  which  has different shades according to different souls...Light which doesn't need a diamond 's gleam but which  can enlighten a diamond with  its  beam...#Lets nurture our talents...  There's  a  whole  lot  of  ruckuses  all  round  the  world,  begging  for #glimmering  glory#internal  peace...  Let's  illuminate  the  flickering  light  of  the world.  Let  our  emanating  lights  promulgate  all  round.  to  every  corner  of  the World...to every eye.#Light inside us.<br><br><hr color="#ffffff"><br clear="left">

            I have one beautiful garden in my house and I want to share my experience about my  green  garden.  When  I  am  free  I  go  to  my  garden  to  spend  time  with  the beautiful flowers, I also play with the mud and help my Grandpa to water and to grow the plants. I also help him in seeding. Some of the best memories of my childhood are attached to my garden. I love it when my entire family sits together in the garden to have their evening tea. I also love the winter afternoons when we have our lunch in the garden. It is simply amazing. Having a garden at home is nice. A Garden is the best place in the house according to me. As it is the only place where a person can get relief from a busy life. Moreover, having a garden in the house welcomes many health benefits. For instance, a garden has many plants that give oxygen. Every day in the morning I can hear the chirping of many birds. Birds like sparrow, pigeon and Indian myna come to wake us. My garden has  different  kinds  of  flowers  like  roses,  jasmin,  marigold,  hibiscus,  daisy  etc. Also my garden has different vegetables growing in them. The garden has grass all over the area. As a result, this makes it the best place for any exercise. This ensures that I do not get hurt even if I fall down while playing. Further, my garden has a swing too which is my favourite. Because I can spend hours swinging on it and do not get bored. Sometimes I spend my entire day in the garden completing all my tasks there. But this is only possible whenever I have a holiday. I love my garden so much.<br><br><hr color="#ffffff"><br clear="left">

            Chitter chatter chitter chatter<br>
